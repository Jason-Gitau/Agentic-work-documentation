# 🚀 Building API Orchestration with LangGraph: A Complete Guide

LangGraph empowers you to build **stateful, conditional workflows** that seamlessly integrate API calls, decision logic, and data processing. This guide walks you through every step of creating a robust **API orchestration pipeline** using LangGraph — without skipping a single detail.

---

## 🔧 1. Define the Graph State

Start by defining a structured state using `TypedDict`. This state will be passed between nodes and hold all relevant information such as user messages, API responses, and intermediate results.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[BaseMessage]        # Stores conversation history
    api_results: List[dict]           # Stores responses from external APIs
    # 🛠️ Add more state variables here as needed (e.g., session_id, context flags)
```

> ✅ **Tip:** The `AgentState` acts as the "memory" of your workflow — it persists across all node executions.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Define Nodes for API Interaction and Logic

Each node in the graph is a function that receives the current state, performs an action, and optionally updates the state or returns routing instructions.

### 🌐 API Call Node

This node makes an external HTTP request based on the current state and stores the result.

```python
import requests

def call_external_api(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Extract query from the latest user message
    api_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/data"
    params = {"query": state["messages"][-1].content}  # Example: use last message as query

    # Make the API call
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, params=params)
    
    # Store the JSON response in state
    state["api_results"].append(response.json())
    
    return state
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Ensure error handling (e.g., timeouts, status codes) is added in production.

---

### 🔍 Decision / Routing Node

This node evaluates the outcome of the API call and decides the next step in the workflow.

```python
def decide_next_step(state: AgentState) -> str:
    if state["api_results"] and state["api_results"][-1].get("success"):
        return "process_data"
    else:
        return "handle_error"
```

> 🔄 This function returns a **string** representing the name of the next node — crucial for conditional routing.

---

### 🧩 Other Logic Nodes

Define additional nodes to handle post-API logic:

#### ✅ Process API Data
```python
def process_api_data(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Example: enrich messages with processed data
    processed_data = {"summary": "Data processed successfully"}
    state["messages"].append(("assistant", f"Processed: {processed_data}"))
    return state
```

#### ❌ Handle API Errors
```python
def handle_api_error(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    error_msg = state["api_results"][-1].get("error", "Unknown API error")
    state["messages"].append(("assistant", f"API Error: {error_msg}"))
    return state
```

> 💡 You can expand these nodes to include retries, fallback APIs, or user prompts.

---

## 🔄 3. Build the LangGraph Workflow

Now, assemble the nodes into a directed graph with conditional routing and proper flow control.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Initialize the stateful graph with our defined state schema
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# 🟦 Add nodes to the graph
workflow.add_node("call_api", call_external_api)
workflow.add_node("decide_action", decide_next_step)
workflow.add_node("process_data", process_api_data)
workflow.add_node("handle_error", handle_api_error)

# 🟩 Set the entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("call_api")

# 🔗 Add conditional edges based on decision logic
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "decide_action",  # Node whose return value determines routing
    lambda state: state["next_action"] if "next_action" in state else decide_next_step(state),
    {
        "process_data": "process_data",
        "handle_error": "handle_error"
    },
)

# 🔗 Add direct edges (simple transitions)
workflow.add_edge("call_api", "decide_action")      # After API call → decision
workflow.add_edge("process_data", END)              # Success → End
workflow.add_edge("handle_error", END)              # Error → End

# 🏗️ Compile the graph into an executable application
app = workflow.compile()
```

> 📌 **Important Notes:**
> - `add_conditional_edges` uses the return value of `decide_next_step` to route flow.
> - `END` halts execution gracefully.
> - The graph maintains full state throughout execution.

## ▶️ 4. Invoke the Graph

Start the orchestration by invoking the compiled app with an initial state.

```python
# 🚩 Define initial input
initial_state = {
    "messages": [("user", "Get me data about X")],
    "api_results": []
}

# 🚀 Run the workflow
result = app.invoke(initial_state)

# 🖨️ Output the final state
print(result)
```

> 🎯 **Expected Output Example:**
```python
{
    'messages': [
        ('user', 'Get me data about X'),
        ('assistant', 'Processed: {"summary": "Data processed successfully"}')
    ],
    'api_results': [{'success': True, 'data': {...}}]
}
```

## 🏁 Summary: Why This Structure Works

This approach enables **robust, maintainable API orchestration** by:

✅ **Maintaining state** across steps  
✅ **Supporting conditional logic** (e.g., success/failure branching)  
✅ **Modular design** — easy to test, extend, and debug  
✅ **Seamless integration** with LangChain tools and LLMs (if needed later)  

---

🔁 With this foundation, you can scale to complex workflows involving multiple APIs, parallel calls, user feedback loops, and dynamic routing — all within a clean, visualizable graph structure.
